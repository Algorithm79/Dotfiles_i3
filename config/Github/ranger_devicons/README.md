## Prerequisites
This plugin uses glyphs from a patched NERDfont. So in order for this plugin to work you need to
install a NERDfont and set it as the default font for your terminal.

I personally use the Source Code Pro patched NERDfont(this is also the font displayed in the
screenshot), this and other NERDfonts and the install instructions for these fonts can be found in
the following repository: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

## Install instructions
A makefile is included to install and uninstall this plugin. to install simply run:
`make install` and to uninstall the plugin run `make uninstall`.
